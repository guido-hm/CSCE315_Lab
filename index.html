      <h2 class="title_index">About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Guido Herrera. I am a student at Texas A&M studying Computer Science. I was born in
        Hidalgo, TX and lived in Mexico City for the first 8 years of my life before moving to Reynosa, Tamaulipas, just
        south of the Border with Texas. Despite living in Reynosa, I studied in McAllen, TX most until I graduated from high school.
        Crossing the international border from Mexico to the United states, two completely different worlds,
        was a daily task for me. Despite all the drawbacks one might think this entailed, which are also mostly true, the
        benefit of being exposed to two completely different environments every single day of my life has  helped me open up to accepting
        different cultures and accepting differences in people, lifestyles, and opinions. After High School, I moved to College Station
        where I studied at Texas A&M. I hope to graduate and begin working for a company where I know I can make a difference
        in our world</p>

      <h2 class="title_index">Free Time</h2>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, playing the piano, going to the gym, and hanging out with my friends. I have been playing piano
        for a couple of years now and will continue playing until I can compose my own music. <br><br>Every
        year, I try to join as many Intramural sports as possible; even the sports I dont usually play, like basketball or flag football.
        Even though I don't do quite well in those sports, I still enjoy partking in them and having fun. I will say, I'm a lot better
        at them than I was when I was a freshman.</p>

      <h2 class="title_index">Experience</h2>
      <p>Over these past few years at Texas A&M, I have learned a lot of skills which I am hoping to put to use in the real worlds
        when I graduate. I am profficient in the programming languages of Python and C++, know how to work with tools such as github and unix,
        and have extensive experience working in groups and collaborating with others to complete projects.</p>
