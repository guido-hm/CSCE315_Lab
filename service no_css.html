          <p>I recently signed up to be a volunteer at the Aggieland Humane Society to help out at the animal shelter.
            After I go to the orientation, I will be able to come in and help with various different tasks including walking dogs,
            cleaning the shelter, and helping with administrative tasks.

        <h2>CAMP Camp</h2>
          <img class="service_img" src="images/campcamp.jpg" alt="CAMP Camp Image" style="width:256px;height:256px;">
          <p> In the summer of 2019, I volunteered at a summer camp named CAMP camp. CAMP camp is a place where both children
            and adults with various kinds of disabilities go to enjoy a summer camp specially made with them and their
            disabilities in mind. I spent a week tagging along to one of the campers, going anywhere they wanted to go,
            doing all types of activities with them, and making sure he had a blast.
